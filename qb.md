Passer ratings are the generally accepted standard for evaluating NFL quarterbacks.
I knew a rating of 100 is pretty good, but never knew what makes up the rating.
So out of curiosity I took a look at the wikipedia page and had an idea or my first kata.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating

There are four parts to the NFL formula

A = ((Completions/Attempts) -.3) * 5

B = ((Yards/Attempts) -3) * .25

C = (Touchdowns/Attempt) * 20

D = 2.375-((interceptions/Attempts)* 25)

Finally the passer rating is ((A+B+C+D)/6)* 100

Last year Tom Brady had 432 attempts, 3554 yards, 291 completions, 28 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions.
His passer rating was 112.2

I am expecting ratings rounded to the nearest tenth. Happy coding.
